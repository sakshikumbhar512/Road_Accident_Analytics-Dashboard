Title: Road Accident Analysis

Primary Goal: To monitor and compare Current Year (CY) accident data against Previous Year (PY) performance, highlighting whether safety metrics are improving or declining.

Key Insights & Features
1. High-Level Metrics (Left Sidebar)
The dashboard tracks five core KPIs, all showing a downward trend (which is a positive sign for safety):

Total Casualties: 11.3K (Down 25%)
Total Accidents: 8,093 (Down 24.5%)
Casualty Severity: Breaks down data into Fatal (0.1K), Serious (1,502), and Slight (9,631) categories.

2. Accident Breakdown
Vehicle Type: Cars are by far the largest contributors (8,993), followed by Vans and Bikes.
Road & Location: Most accidents occur on Single Carriageways and in Urban areas.
Light Conditions: Over 60% of accidents happen during the day, though a significant portion (38.7%) occurs in the dark.

3. Trends & Geography
Time Analysis: A line graph compares the current year to the previous year, showing a noticeable spike in casualties toward the end of the year (November/December).
Interactive Map: A visual heatmap on the right pinpointing specific accident clusters, allowing users to zoom into high-risk zones.

Summary Note: The dashboard is highly effective because it uses color-coded icons and percentage indicators to show at a glance that while numbers are high, the overall trend is moving toward fewer accidents.
